I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My current interest is on Natural Language Processing. More specifically, I am interested in explaining why models work, creating dataset that transfers well and understand common sense. 

This picture is the animated version of me in Feb 2020. I used to look exactly like this, of course.

### More Information

I play drums, sometimes guitars.

I used to be a heavy gamer (maybe still is). I solo qued top 500 NA in Rainbow Six Siege when it was still enjoyable, but now the devs destroyed the game.
